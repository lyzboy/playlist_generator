Implement Spotify Search Request
Connect the search bar to Spotify so that it can query data from the Spotify API. Your implementation should enable users to enter a search parameter and receive a response from the Spotify API. You should display the results from the request to the user.

To make your request to the API, use the /v1/search?type=TRACKendpoint. You can refer to the Spotify Web API Endpoint Reference for guidance on formatting your request.

You can use fetch() to make your GET requests and you should be expecting the response back as a list of tracks in JSON format.

It is best to convert the JSON to an array of tracks, the array should be a list of track objects with the following properties: id, name, artist, album, and uri.

Common errors to avoid:

Invalid access tokens: Make sure that you use valid access tokens before making your requests.
Incorrect API endpoint: Make sure you use /v1/search?type=TRACK as outlined in the documentation.
Incorrectly formatted requests: Refer to the Endpoint Reference documentation for guidance on how to format your requests.
